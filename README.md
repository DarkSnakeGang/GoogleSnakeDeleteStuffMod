<h1>Visibility Mod</h1>

To install:

This has moved. It is now part of Google Snake Modloader. Please see [here](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/blob/main/README.md) for install instructions. It has been renamed to visibility mod.

This mod lets you delete different parts of the snake, and the background.

Checking flash on eat will show the snake briefly after eating an apple (You will need to deselect some parts of the snake first).

You can reposition the mod by dragging the top left.
